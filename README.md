## Features

- **SQLite Database:** Local database setup using SQLite for storing and managing data. So there is no need to connect or setup your own database, the inital launch of the application will handle all of that.
- **MaterialSkin.2 UI:** Enhanced user interface powered by MaterialSkin.2 controls for a modern look and feel.
- **Customization:** Light mode and dark mode with numerous theme options available to the user. You can also edit the column order of the grid and the visibility of columns via a menu item, as well as hide/show any or all search criteria as you wish. All changes are saved to the database and applied on launch.
- **Data management:** Allows users to export and import data via .CSV files, as well as purging all contents.
- **Record management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing records.
